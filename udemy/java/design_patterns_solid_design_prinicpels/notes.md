# Notes to Java Design Patterns

A **solid** design principle for OOP Patterns

S - Single Responsibility principle

  There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

O - Open closed principle

   Software Entities (like Classes, Modules, Methods etc.)
   should be open for extension but closer for modification

L - Liskov substitution principle

  We should be to substitute base class object with child class objects &
  this should not alter behavior / characteristics of program

I - Intervace segregation principle

  Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use

D - Dependency inversion principle

   1. High level modules should not depend upon low level modules.
      Both should depend upon abstractions
   2. Abstractions should not depend upon details.
      Details should depend upon abstractions
