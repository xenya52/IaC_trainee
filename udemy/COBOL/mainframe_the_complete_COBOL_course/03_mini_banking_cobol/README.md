# Mini-Banking-System

## My Goals

- Simple managing of bank accounts
- Transfer between accounts
- Show the current balance

## Folder structure

`main.cbl` – Main menu and control
`utils.cbl` – Utility functions (e.g., input validation)
`filehandler.cbl` – Loading & saving accounts
`transfer.cbl` – Transfer logic
