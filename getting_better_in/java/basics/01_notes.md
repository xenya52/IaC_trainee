# Java bascis

The **Java Development Kit (JDK)** is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java **Runtime Environment (JRE / JVM)**, an **interpreter/loader (Java)**, a **compiler (javac)**, an **archiver (jar)**, a **documentation generator (Javadoc)**, **a debugger (jdb)**, and other tools needed in Java development.

Gradle Maven = Build automation tools ("used to build software")

java SE / ME / PK / EE = Java Editions

| **Basis**                | **Gradle**                                                                                       | **Maven**                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Based on**             | Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects.                                 | Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software.                              |
| **Configuration**        | It uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language (DSL) for creating project structure.            | It uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for creating project structure.                     |
| **Focuses on**           | Developing applications by adding new features to them.                                         | Developing applications in a given time limit.                                               |
| **Performance**          | It performs better than Maven as it is optimized for tracking only the current running task.     | It does not create local temporary files during software creation and is hence slower.       |
| **Java Compilation**     | It avoids compilation.                                                                          | It is necessary to compile.                                                                  |
| **Usability**            | It is a new tool, which requires users to spend a lot of time to get used to it.                 | This tool is a known tool for many users and is easily available.                            |
| **Customization**        | This tool is highly customizable as it supports a variety of IDEs.                              | This tool serves a limited number of developers and is not that customizable.                |
| **Languages supported**  | It supports software development in Java, C, C++, and Groovy.                                   | It supports software development in Java, Scala, C#, and Ruby.                               |
|                          |                                                                                                  | It does not natively support C and C++ but can support through plugins like "maven-native-plugin" or by integrating other build systems like CMake or Makefile. |
| **Project Configuration**| For declaring the project configuration, it does not use the XML files.                         | For declaring the project configuration, it uses the XML files.                              |
| **Based on**             | Graph of task dependencies that do the work.                                                    | On the phases of the fixed and linear model.                                                 |
| **Goal**                 | To add functionality in the project is the main goal of Gradle.                                 | To finish the project in the given timeline is the main goal of Maven.                       |
