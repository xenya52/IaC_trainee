# game-2048

Welcome to the **game-2048** project! This is a simple yet addictive sliding tile puzzle game where the objective is to combine numbered tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (or swipe gestures, if supported) to slide the tiles on the grid.
2. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with their values added together.
3. The game ends when there are no more valid moves left.
4. Your goal is to create a tile with the number 2048, but you can keep playing to achieve even higher scores!

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Playable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
